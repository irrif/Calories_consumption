# Calories_consumption

I collected personal data from Garmin Connect website on CSV file.

Then using python, I changed data types and selected datas I wanted, wrote them back into separate CSV files.

In the end, there is a representation of Calories Consumption in terms of Effort Duration and Distance, using Tableau.
