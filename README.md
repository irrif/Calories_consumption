# Calories_consumption

Collected data from Garmin Connect website, into CSV file.

Then with python using Pandas, I changed data types and selected datas I wanted, wrote them back into separate CSV files.

In the end, using Tableau I represented Calories Consumption in terms of Effort Duration and Distance.
